MPI Wrappers:
initParallel -> Does all the usual initialisation of ranks/size
destroyParallel -> Finalizes MPI
barrierParallel -> MPI_Barrier
sendReceiveParallel-> Does a send-receive and returns the number of bytes received
addIntParallel -> Allreduce for sum of ints
addRealParallel -> Allreduce for sum of reals
addDoubleParallel -> Allreduce for sum of doubles
maxIntParallel -> Allreduce for max int
minRankDoubleParallel -> Allreduce using MPI_MINLOC on MPI_DOUBLE_INTs
maxRankDoubleParallel -> Allreduce using MPI_MAXLOC on MPI_DOUBLE_INTs
bcastParallel -> Broadcast
